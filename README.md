This app is built using OpenWeather API. It takes a city as an input from the user and uses the API to display weather information for the current day and the upcoming 5 day forcast. The information includes  the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index. If the user enters no city and tries to search, it returns an error. The cities that are searched for are saved and displayed in a list.

It is meant to have functionality where the user clicks on a city from the city list and the weather display will re-appear, but was not completed.

Built using HTML, CSS, jQuery.
